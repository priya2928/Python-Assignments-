    "\n",
    "Ans:Inheritance is creating a PARENT-CHILD relationship between two classes where child automatically get the properties and methods of the parent. Why inheritance is an important concept in software? Inheritance is good for: REUSABILITY and ABSTRACTION of code."

    "differences and advantages.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:In inheritance, the existing class is called the parent class, superclass or the base class. The new class called the child class, subclass or derived class. Using inheritance, the subclass can use the properties and methods of the superclass. Thus, programmers do not have to implement the whole program from the beginning. Single inheritance is the simplest form of inheritance.\n",

    "&\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiple inheritance, the new class can use the properties and methods of multiple classes. Programmer can implement multiple inheritance in languages such as C++. However, languages such as Java and C# does not support multiple inheritance. Instead, these languages use interfaces to implement multiple inheritance."

    "\n",
    "Ans:When a class member is declared as public, it can be accessed from anywhere. If a class member is declared as protected, it can only be accessed within the class itself and its parent and inherited classes. If a class member is declared as private, only the defining class can access it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:The 'super' keyword allows referencing the parent class or superclass of a subclass in Java. It is often employed to access members (fields or methods) of the superclass that have been overridden in the subclass. You can call the superclass's method from within the subclass using super. methodName()."
