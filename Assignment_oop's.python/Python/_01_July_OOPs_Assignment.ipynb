    "**Q1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming.\n",
    "It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "Some Advantages are mentioned below:\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making problem solving easy through the use of objects\n",
    "Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
    "Multiple instances of an object can be made and explored."

    "**Q2. What is an object in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Objects are variables that contain data and functions that can be used to manipulate the data. The object's data can vary in type (string, integer, etc.) depending on how it's been defined. An object is like a mini-program inside python, with its own set of rules and behaviors."

    "**Q3. What is a class in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class . An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class."

    "\n",
    "Ans:In object-oriented programming (OOP), attributes are variables belonging to an object or class and containing information about their properties or characteristics. At the same time, methods are functions that belong to an object or class and are designed to perform actions involving the object's attributes."

    "\n",
    "Ans:Class variables and instance variables are both important concepts in object-oriented programming. Class variables are shared across all instances of a class, while instance variables are unique to each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences between a class object and an instance object are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class is a template for creating objects whereas object is an instance of class\n",
    "Seperate memory is allocated for each object whenever an object is created. but for a class this does not happens.\n",
    "A Class is created once. Many objects are created using a class.\n",
    "As Classes have no allocated memory. they can't be manipulated. but objects can be manipulated."
